      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our team has noticed that many of our peers have not been connecting as
        much with each other. We are disconnected and alone most of the time and
        our application is the solution to that. Our application plans on being
        the link between professors and students by creating a message board
        where both students and professors can chat about different topics.
        Overall, the purpose is to allow people on campus to interact with each
        other and get advice on different topics. There will also be an official
        announcement tab where important announcements will be posted so
        everyone can see them. In addition, we plan on having different groups
        which will allow groups of like-minded people to connect with each
        other. We believe that could be a great social environment for everyone
        on campus to learn more about what’s happening on campus and for people
        to interact with each other and meet new people. This will allow more
        events to be advertised, students to be more involved in different
        events on campus, and a stronger sense of community within our campus.
      </p>

      <h2 id="application-parts">Application Parts</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>University Message Board:</strong>The message board is the base
        aspect of the application. It is a space where anyone in the university
        can post and interact with each other. Users can share thoughts,
        socialize, get advice for campus life, school work, and careers, discuss
        campus news, and anything else they would like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Official Announcements:</strong> This will also be a platform
        where important announcements can be distributed and discussed in one
        place. This can include news or reminders about schedules and holidays,
        school closures, transportation, dorms, or any other university
        services. The design of the application allows these announcements to be
        centralized and also more interactive. Users can ask questions and
        clarifications about the posts and give their input and the university
        can quickly get feedback from the community through this interaction or
        through additional polls or surveys.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Community Groups:</strong> The application also allows for
        a wide range of more specific groups to be formed. It includes a place
        where new campus job openings can be posted and applicants can find and
        apply for them, a similar space for sharing volunteer opportunities, and
        a lost and found platform to make finding lost items on campus much
        easier and more collaborative with the community. And the university can
        create any other helpful group as the usage of the application develops.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-requirements">Data Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>University Message Board:</strong>As the base element of the
        application, the storage of messages displayed on the message board will
        be critical in determining the success of the mission behind our
        application. Each message will have to have its text, user source, and
        associated tags saved in order to allow for user-to-user socialization,
        as well as filtration for user-specific relevant categories of
        information. Naturally, some light extent of user information will need
        to be stored for every user in order to allow for the creation of a
        virtual identity in our application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Official Announcements:</strong> The official announcements are
        the second most critical portion of the application. Its data
        requirements are similar to the data requirements of the message board,
        however, they will have to be distinctly saved in order to not be
        confused with generic messages when working with them in the backend.
        This could mean creating separate tables for messages and announcements
        or combining the two and having each entry identified as either a
        message or announcement. Both implementations have their pros and cons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Community Groups:</strong> The storage of different groups
        will be important for this portion of the application. There will be a
        protocol in the application to register a group and, once approved, the
        group would then be added to an official table of groups, the user
        administrators of which would have access to more diverse functionality
        within the application. The relations between groups and users will be
        an important data requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> On the most fundamental level, the data
        requirements for this application boil down to storage of user
        information, group information, and messages from either entity. There
        are nuances to the message types and there need to be logical relations
        implemented between the three different entities, especially as the
        diversity of functionality potentially expands. But, in our MVP, the
        data requirements can be summarized by those three things.

          The home page will have the user’s main feed which shows the posts
          most important and relevant to them. For example, the important
          university announcements will be prioritized, as well as posts from
          groups the user is active/interested in, replies in conversations they
          are part of, or generally popular and interesting posts of the day.
          This page also has options to filter the feed or write a new post and
          gives access to specific groups on the side that can be explored.

      <h2 id="real-world-connection">Real-World Connection</h2>

      <p>
        There is a prevalent issue within education, that is the fragmentation
        of communication. In many universities, information dissemination is
        scattered across various platforms such as emails, physical bulletin
        boards, social media, and department-specific newsletters. This
        dispersion creates a situation where important announcements, job
        openings, and event information can easily be overlooked by the intended
        audience, leading to lower participation rates, uninformed students, and
        a disconnected campus community. We took influence from the University
        of Michigan’s application which focuses on centralizing campus news,
        events, and various other factors by creating a central application. By
        providing a central platform where staff can post announcements, job
        listings, and event details, you're ensuring that all students have
        equal access to crucial information. This not only enhances the sense of
        community and belonging among students but also ensures that
        opportunities for professional development, academic engagement, and
        social interaction are maximally leveraged. These forms of applications
        can help foster engagement, which will build a more efficient and
        inclusive student body. They’re various applications around the world
        that have been made to help with engagement. From dating apps such as
        Tinder, to UMichigan’s app, to even Facebook and Instagram. Creating
        centralized platforms provides the user base with better engagement and
        a sense of community. This app can provide utility to both staff and
        students as they are able to communicate campus-wide.

      <h2 id="integrative-experience">Integrative Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Most undergraduates’ classes are unrelated to each other which is what
        makes the Integrative experience so important. It allows us to connect
        everything we’ve learned in the past to create something different. This
        project satisfies the Integrative Experience requirements because this
        project would allow us to practice different aspects of web design that
        we’ve learned in the past integrated with what we are interested in. We
        have each taken numerous computer science classes and we think this
        project will accurately showcase what we’ve learned throughout our
        college experience. We feel like this project is a great opportunity to
        allow our peers and us to become more involved on campus, meet new
        people, and help out our community. We have different filters because we
        want this project to help out students with different aspects like our
        job filter or the club filter. We have all seen something similar like
        Yikyak, an app we discovered as freshmen, where we have seen our peers
        frequently using it which got us thinking about how this would be
        something students would be interested in. We also have all gone through
        periods in our college lives where we felt like we were missing out on
        events and we believe this app would allow students to become more
        involved on campus..

# UYap
UYap is a platform for UMass students to communicate freely with each other.


Our application has four views, a login view, a sign-up view, the home page, and a view for creating a post.


After running the milestone-03 script, you will be brought to the login page. Login in with your username as password and the application will verify that they are correct and if so bring you to the homepage. 

If you do not yet have an account, choose sign up. Choose a username and password. The application will make sure the password you choose meets password requirements, verify that it matches the retype password field and save your login information in the database. 


After logging in, you will be brought to the homepage which shows you the feed of posts. You can scroll to view more posts, press the reload button to refresh your feed, or choose tags using the buttons on the side. Choosing a button will filter your feed based on your chosen tags. 

From this home page, you can also press the log out button at the top to log out of your account and bring you back to the log in page. There is also the option to change your password with the change password button. Enter your current password, then the new one and the changes will be saved in the database. 

On the feed, you can also delete posts. Any post you have made will have a delete button at the bottom.

To create a new post, click on the button in the bottom left. It will bring you to a form where you can add a title, a body, and tags that match your post. The application will notify you if you forget to fill in the title or body fields. After you are done, you can click the post button and then it will show up on the feed with the time, the title, your username, and your body text.
